# connectome-brain-age-gap
This directory contains custom codes for the study "Multi-omic Profiling of a Novel Brain Age Gap Links Multisystem Health to the Connectome".
The code primarily consists of a modified brain connectome computation pipeline and the MB-GAT brain age prediction model. The original connectome computation pipeline is based on micapipe, which can be found at: https://github.com/MICA-MNI/micapipe/tree/master
